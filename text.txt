Are you (are you)
Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to)
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to)
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night

Play fair (play fair)
Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature)
Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there)
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)

But if you really wanna go there
You should know I

Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo

Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
(Training season's over)

I tried (I tried)
To see my lovers in a good light (good light)
Don't wanna do it just to be nice (be nice)
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right

I hope (I hope)
It hits me like an arrow (arrow)
Someone with some potential (potential)
Is it too much to ask for?

Who understands I

Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo

Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over

Can you compete?
Now is your time
Run when you hear that whistle blow
Are you on my team
Or stuck on the sidelines
Waiting for someone to tell you to go?
For someone to tell you to go

You should know I

Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah)
Conversation overload
